# Contact form with validation states

Enter your details in the form fields. If your details are wrong or if the fields are empty, an error state will appear

## A user should:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
    - A required field has been missed
    - The email address is not formatted correctly
    - Complete the form only using their keyboard
    - Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
    - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
